ABSTRACT
An emotion-based music recommendation system is an innovative approach to music
recommendation that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend music based on the
emotionalstate of the listener. The idea behind this system is to create a personalized music
experience for the listener, helping them discover new music that resonates with their
current mood and emotions. This type of recommendation system is particularly useful for
individuals who use music as a means of emotional regulation, such as those with anxiety
or depression.The proposed system detects the emotion of a person, if the person has a
negative emotion, then a certain playlist is played which will enhance his mood. If a person
has positive emotions, then a specific playlist is played which will inflate the positive
emotions. Nowadays streaming networks have access to millions of tracks. The music
recommendation system assists in efficiently perusing enormous collections. A music
recommender system learns from a user's prior listening behaviour and suggeststracksthey
might enjoy hearing in the future.
